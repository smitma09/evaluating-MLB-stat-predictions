# evaluating-MLB-stat-predictions
The repository holds files used to evaluate how well different predictive models do at predicting a MLB player's stats over the course of a full season. The 2018 files will be updated after the current MLB season concludes, as there is not yet complete statistical information for the season. Currently, the 2018 files have raw data different hitting projections stored from the 2018 season, along with an IPython Notebook where the data is manipulated and cleansed before computing average projections for each player. A similar notebook for pitching projections for the 2018 season is coming soon.

The projections used for the 2018 season are "ATC", "The Bat", "Depth Charts", "Steamer", and "ZiPS". The raw data of each projection for each player was downloaded from FanGraphs at www.fangraphs.com/projections.aspx. Additonally, the notebook computes an average projection for each player to see if doing so creates a projection any more accurate than any of the original projections individually. After the 2018 season finishes, the notebook will be updated with calculations and visualizations about how well each projection model did.

Pending the availability of projections from prior seasons (2017, 2016, etc), notebooks that evaluate historical projections will be added to this repository to better judge how different models have historically performed.
